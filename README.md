# Kalkulator
I made this calculator program to fulfill the UAS assignment for the Web Programming course taught by Lecturer Pak Zico Alamsyah, S.Si, MTI. This is a simple web calculator that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also includes features to clear the current input, delete the last digit, and clear all content including the history of operations.
